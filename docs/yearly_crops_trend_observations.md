# Crops Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis of the time series graph that plots the average yield (Kg per ha) for various crops over the years. The chart serves as a visual tool to understand historical performance, detect trends, and identify outlier behavior in crop yields.

## Key Observations

### 1. High-Yield Outlier: Sugarcane
- **Distinct Performance:**  
  The yield of sugarcane is significantly higher than that of other crops, typically ranging between 4,000 and 5,000 Kg per ha.
- **Implication:**  
  This result is expected given that sugarcane is often grown for high tonnage per hectare. However, its dominance on the graph makes it challenging to compare with crops that have relatively lower yields.

### 2. Mid-Range Cluster of Crops
- **Concentration:**  
  The three crops rice, wheat, and maize show above average yields clustering between 1500 and 2,500 Kg per ha.
- **Group Characteristics:**
  - **Cereals:** Typically display mid-range values (rice, wheat, maize).
  - **Pulses:** Often present lower yields.
  - **Oilseeds:** Lowest yield
  

### 3. Overall Stability and Variability
- **Year-to-Year Trends:**  
  Although all crops display some variability, the fluctuations from year to year are generally modest. There are no dramatic peaks or troughs across the entire timeframe.
  Year 2003 shows dips for all crops due to a 19% monsoon rainfall deficiency at the national level.
  
- **Interpretation:**  
  This stability suggests consistent agricultural practices over time, though the moderate changes may reflect gradual improvements, weather variations, or policy impacts.


## Summary

The yield time series graph effectively visualizes historical crop performance and reveals:
- A markedly higher yield for sugarcane.
- A clustering of most crops in the moderate yield range.
- Consistent yields across most years with modest fluctuations.
- Seasonal differences, particularly in sorghum types.
