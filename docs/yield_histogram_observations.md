# Yield Histogram Observations

## Yield Histogram Observations

### Data Overview:
- **Variable:** Yields for RICE, WHEAT, KHARIF SORGHUM, RABI SORGHUM, SORGHUM, PEARL MILLET, MAIZE, FINGER MILLET, BARLEY, CHICKPEA, PIGEONPEA, MINOR PULSES, GROUNDNUT, SESAMUM, RAPESEED AND MUSTARD, SAFFLOWER, CASTOR, SUNFLOWER, SOYABEAN, OILSEEDS, SUGARCANE, COTTON
- **Measurement:** Kilograms per hectare
- **Dataset:** Historical yield data from 1990 to 2015

### Distribution Analysis:
- **Skewness:**  
  The histogram is right-skewed, indicating that while most fields report moderate yields, there is a long tail of observations with exceptionally high yields.
  
- **Central Tendency:**  
  Most yield values are clustered between 2500 and 3200 Kg per ha, suggesting a standard range for typical yield performance.

- **Variability and Outliers:**  
  A long tail and several outlier points suggests that a small number of fields achieve much higher yields than the majority. These outliers could be the result of favorable microclimates, exceptional farming practices, or potential data errors.

### Implications for Modeling:
- **Transformations:**  
  Due to the right-skewness, applying a log transformation to the yield data might normalize the distribution, which can be beneficial for certain models (e.g., linear regression). However, for tree-based models like XGBoost, which are generally robust to skewed data, this may be less critical.
  
- **Model Selection:**  
  The skewness indicates that while many models can be used, careful consideration should be given to handling the outliers. It might be valuable to compare models built on both raw and transformed data.

### Visual Insights:
- The histogram visually confirms that the majority of yield observations are moderate with a small proportion of extreme high values.
- This insight supports the hypothesis that yield performance is not uniformly distributed and that external factors (e.g., weather conditions, soil quality) could be influencing these outliers.
